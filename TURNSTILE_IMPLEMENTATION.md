# Cloudflare Turnstile Implementation for Intellectif Booking System

## Overview

This document outlines the complete implementation of Cloudflare Turnstile security verification in the Intellectif booking system. The implementation provides robust bot protection and security validation for the customer booking flow.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **`/components/ui/Turnstile.tsx`** - Reusable Turnstile widget component
2. **`/hooks/useTurnstile.ts`** - Custom hook for Turnstile state management
3. **`/api/turnstile/verify/route.ts`** - Server-side validation endpoint

### Integration Points

- **Customer Booking Flow**: Integrated into `CustomerInformation.tsx` component
- **Form Validation**: Required before booking submission
- **Server-side Verification**: Validates tokens with Cloudflare API

## Environment Variables

```env
# Required environment variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=your_site_key_here
TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
```

**Important**:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` must have the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for client-side access
- `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` is server-side only and should not have the prefix

## Features

### Client-side Features

- ✅ Automatic widget rendering with dark theme
- ✅ Real-time verification state management
- ✅ Automatic token refresh on expiration
- ✅ Error handling with user feedback
- ✅ Seamless integration with booking form

### Server-side Features

- ✅ Token validation with Cloudflare API
- ✅ IP address detection and logging
- ✅ Idempotency key generation
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ CORS support

### Security Features

- ✅ Server-side token validation required
- ✅ Token expiration handling
- ✅ Automatic widget reset on errors
- ✅ Network error recovery
- ✅ Form submission blocking until verified

## Usage

### Basic Implementation

The Turnstile verification is automatically integrated into the booking flow. Customers must complete the security verification before they can submit their booking.

### Booking Flow Integration

1. Customer fills out booking information
2. Security verification section appears
3. Customer completes Turnstile challenge
4. Form submission is enabled only after verification
5. Server validates token before creating booking

## API Reference

### Turnstile Component Props

```typescript
interface TurnstileProps {
  onSuccess?: (token: string) => void;
  onError?: () => void;
  onExpire?: () => void;
  onLoad?: () => void;
  className?: string;
}
```

### useTurnstile Hook Returns

```typescript
{
  token: string | null;
  isVerified: boolean;
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  handleSuccess: (token: string) => void;
  handleError: () => void;
  handleExpire: () => void;
  validateToken: () => Promise<boolean>;
  reset: () => void;
  turnstileRef: RefObject<TurnstileRef | null>;
}
```

### API Endpoint

**POST** `/api/turnstile/verify`

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "token": "turnstile_token_here"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "challengeTs": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "hostname": "your-domain.com"
}
```

## Testing

### Development Testing

1. Set up environment variables in `.env.local`
2. Use Cloudflare's test site keys for development
3. Test the booking flow with security verification
4. Verify server-side validation is working

### Test Site Keys

For testing purposes, you can use these Cloudflare test keys:

- **Site Key**: `1x00000000000000000000AA` (always passes)
- **Site Key**: `2x00000000000000000000AB` (always fails)
- **Site Key**: `3x00000000000000000000FF` (always forces interactive challenge)

### Production Testing

1. Configure your production domain in Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Use real site keys from your Cloudflare Turnstile configuration
3. Test from different networks and devices
4. Monitor Cloudflare Analytics for verification metrics

## Debugging

### Common Issues

1. **Widget not appearing**:

   - Check environment variables are set correctly
   - Verify domain is configured in Cloudflare Dashboard
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Verification failing**:

   - Ensure server-side validation endpoint is working
   - Check network connectivity to Cloudflare
   - Verify secret key is correct

3. **Analytics not showing data**:
   - Confirm server-side validation is implemented
   - Check that tokens are being validated via API
   - Verify site key matches Cloudflare configuration

### Debug Information

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling and user feedback:

- Visual feedback for verification states
- Error messages for failed verifications
- Automatic retry mechanisms
- Network error recovery

## Production Deployment

### Checklist

- [ ] Environment variables configured correctly
- [ ] Domain added to Cloudflare Turnstile configuration
- [ ] Server-side validation endpoint deployed
- [ ] SSL/HTTPS enabled (required for Turnstile)
- [ ] Content Security Policy configured if needed

### Security Best Practices

1. **Always validate server-side**: Never trust client-side verification alone
2. **Use HTTPS**: Turnstile requires secure connections
3. **Monitor analytics**: Track verification success rates
4. **Handle errors gracefully**: Provide clear feedback to users
5. **Implement retry logic**: Allow users to retry failed verifications

## Monitoring

### Cloudflare Analytics

Monitor your Turnstile implementation through:

- Verification success rates
- Challenge solve rates
- Error rates by type
- Geographic distribution

### Application Monitoring

Track in your application:

- Booking completion rates
- Verification abandonment
- Error frequency
- User experience metrics

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

1. Monitor Cloudflare Analytics for unusual patterns
2. Review error logs for verification issues
3. Update dependencies regularly
4. Test functionality after deployments

### Key Rotation

If you need to rotate your secret key:

1. Generate new keys in Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Update environment variables
3. Deploy changes
4. Monitor for any issues

## Support

For issues with:

- **Cloudflare Turnstile**: Check Cloudflare documentation and support
- **Implementation**: Review this documentation and error logs
- **Integration**: Ensure all components are properly connected
